Simple voting and rating system. In simplest case you just need to insert in your text just one word: [voting].

== Description ==

This plugin can understand two shortcodes: 

*<strong>[voting]</strong>
*<strong>[voted]</strong>

Let's look at the variants of their usage.

1. Simplest (and most popular) using.
Just insert in your article or page this simple shortcode:<br><strong>[voting]</strong><br>This shortcode will be replaced with a voting form, which allow your visitors to rate current article or page. When one of the voting buttons pressed, this form will disappear, and voting result will be shown instead.<br><br>You can also use another shortcode:<br><strong>[voted]</strong><br>This shortcode will just show the current article rating.<br><br>If you have administrative privileges, then, while browsing through your articles, you will see near each voting form the button with a title <strong>'You are admin. Check answers'</strong>. This button will allow admins to see the list of all votes for this subject.<br><br>That's all you need to know about simplest using of the Simple Voting plugin.
2. <strong>Voting for arbitrary subjects</strong>

If you want to allow your visitors to vote for an arbitrary subject, you must use more complex shortcode
construction, like this:

<strong>[voting]Arbitrary subject name[/voting]</strong>

Such block of code could be placed in any article, and will rate the same 'Arbitrary subject name'.
To show the rating of the 'Arbitrary subject name', use following shortcode:

[voted]Arbitrary subject name[/voted]

3. Voting with redirection (for experienced webmasters). 

Immediately after voting, visitor (and information about his vote) could be sent to another web page.
Just include URL of desired page somewhere in the subject name.
Let's imagine, that after voting, you want to send visitor to the URL http://somesite.com/somepage.php
To accomplish this, you must write something like this:

[voting]http://somesite.com/somepage.php Subject name[/voting]

Or something like this:

[voting]
Another
subject
http://somesite.com/somepage.php
[/voting]

Or just that:

[voting]http://somesite.com/somepage.php[/voting]

Note that although in all these examples I used same URL (http://somesite.com/somepage.php),  they are
DIFFERENT voting subjects, because texts inside shortcode tags are different.

Note. To show the rating of the subjects from above examples, you must use [voted] shortcode instead
of [voting] one. Like this:

[voted]http://somesite.com/somepage.php Subject name[/voted]

[voted]
Another
subject
http://somesite.com/somepage.php
[/voted]

[voted]http://somesite.com/somepage.php[/voted]

After voting on any of these subjects, user will be sent to the given web page
(http://somesite.com/somepage.php in our examples). To this page also will be POSTed data, containing
following information about voting subject:

sv_vote – user’s vote (from 1 to 10)
sv_textID – unique subject identifier, which consists of three letters, concatenated with a numeric ID.
svUserName – user name
svUserEmail – user’s Email
svUserComment – user’s comment
sv_nonce – one time code, generated by the function: wp_create_nonce( 'simple-voting' ). This code used for security purposes, but you may ignore it.

4. Database tables.

Simple voting plugin stores all information in two database tables:
<strong>
</br>{db_prefix}simple_voting_subjects
</br>{db_prefix}simple_voting_votes
</strong>

That’s all. Fill free to to ask any questions: seoringer@gmail.com
